                    </br>
                    <p class="Infos">Introduced at this year's Mobile World Congress, the Tizen-based Samsung Gear 2 (Review) has been given a update that improves the S Health and also introduces a new notification-related feature.
                    </br></br>
                    Bringing the software version from 2.2.1.1 to 2.2.1.2, the update is available via the Gear 2's 'Gear Manager' option. The update brings also general stability to the smartwatch and certain improvements to S Health - the details of which are not known.
                    Sammobile notes the new Gear 2 notification feature is called 'Blocking Mode'. The Blocking Mode feature enables users to mute all the notifications when activated. The feature can be active all the time or can be switched on while the user is asleep.
                    </br></br>
                    It has been also mentioned that Samsung's Gear 2 Neo smartwatch, which was introduced along with the Gear 2 smartwatch, is also receiving an update as well. The details of the same are not yet known.
                    </br></br>
                    Last month, it was reported that Samsung is developing a smartwatch that can make or receive calls without having to be tethered to a mobile phone. The firm is reportedly in discussions with unidentified US, Korean and European telecommunications carriers about a so-called "watch-phone" that is said to be unveiled between this month and next month.
                    </br></br>
                    Last month, a Samsung spokesperson confirmed that the Android OS in the company's first smartwatch, the Galaxy Gear, will be stripped off and will be reloaded with Tizen. Unfortunately, the South Korean giant did not share any details about the schedule of the update release. In addition to this, images of the Samsung Galaxy Gear's (Hands-On) test build running Tizen OS also surfaced online.
